1. Add a loveable demo walk through - lovable is great at making these. 
2. Create an one click context engine will tht take the ui on screen analyzes the element and details tranforms it into a prompt based on user instructions. 

3. update the temrinal edit and modification to the chrome extension. 


error: When the debugger is opened using the chrome extension the the blue highligted section rremains in the way. 



Alignment in ui between the web app demo and the ui of the chrome extension. (icons sleek temrinal colors ui. Although the way the text is structured is way cleaner to read.)






Test the Full Flow
Inspect an element, add user intent, generate the prompt, and copy it.
Paste into ChatGPT/Cursor and verify the context is clear and actionable.
Would you like me to start with Step 2 (add the user intent input in the Interactive Panel or Debug Modal)? If so, which UI location do you prefer for the intent input and prompt preview:
Interactive Panel (side panel on inspect)
Debug Modal (full modal on debug)
New “Prompt” tab in the terminal
Let me know your preference and I’ll implement the next step!
