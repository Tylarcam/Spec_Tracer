#Idea add this as an example  for tranforming prompt in Prompt OS

Prompt Transformer: 

Original Prompt: Lets update the icon over lay. I do not want two icons. Only show the bug icon. When clicked shift to the search Icon not a green checkmark. when the user presses the search icon again it will toggle of going back to the bug icon. 

Transformed Prompt : Let's Update the floating toggle button to have just two states:
Bug Icon (üêõ) - LogTrace is OFF
Search Icon (üîç) - LogTrace is ON
When clicked, it toggles between these two states. Let me find and update the content script


New prompt for llm instructional tranformation: 
To address the issues you've described, you can modify the CSS for your element. Here‚Äôs a prompt you can use to make the necessary changes: ### CSS Modifications 1. **Add Padding to the Right of the Text** To ensure the text is not cut off, you can add right padding to the `.space-y-1.text-xs.max-h-32.overflow-y-auto` class. Here‚Äôs how to do it: ```css .space-y-1.text-xs.max-h-32.overflow-y-auto { padding-right: 16px; /* Adjust this value as needed */ } ``` 2. **Change the Vertical Scroll Wheel Design** To match the terminal design for the scroll wheel, you can customize the scrollbar styles. Add the following CSS: ```css .space-y-1.text-xs.max-h-32.overflow-y-auto { scrollbar-width: thin; /* For Firefox */ scrollbar-color: #00ff00 #000000; /* Scrollbar color and background */ } /* For WebKit browsers (Chrome, Safari) */ .space-y-1.text-xs.max-h-32.overflow-y-auto::-webkit-scrollbar { width: 8px; /* Adjust width */ } .space-y-1.text-xs.max-h-32.overflow-y-auto::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb { background-color: #00ff00; /* Thumb color */ border-radius: 10px; /* Rounded edges */ } .space-y-1.text-xs.max-h-32.overflow-y-auto::-webkit-scrollbar-track { background: #000000; /* Track color */ } ``` ### Implementation Steps 1. Add or modify the CSS in your stylesheet. 2. Save the changes and refresh your web page to see the effects. 3. Adjust padding and scrollbar styles as necessary to achieve the desired look. ### Testing After implementing the changes, test the appearance and functionality in multiple browsers to ensure compatibility and consistency.



Transformed Prompt:

I need to modify the CSS styling for a scrollable text container with the class .space-y-1.text-xs.max-h-32.overflow-y-auto. Please help me make two specific improvements:
Issue 1: Text Cut-off Prevention

Add right padding to prevent text from being cut off at the container's edge
Ensure content remains fully readable when scrolling

Issue 2: Terminal-Style Scrollbar Design

Replace the default scrollbar with a terminal/console-themed design
Use green (#00ff00) for the scrollbar thumb on a black (#000000) background
Make the scrollbar thin and visually consistent with a terminal interface
Ensure cross-browser compatibility (WebKit and Firefox)

Requirements:

Maintain the existing functionality of the scrollable container
Keep the max-height constraint of 32 units
Preserve the text sizing and spacing classes
Provide a solution that works across modern browsers

Expected Outcome:
A scrollable text container with proper padding that prevents text truncation and features a custom terminal-style scrollbar that enhances the overall aesthetic while maintaining usability.
