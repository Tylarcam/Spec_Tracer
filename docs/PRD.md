Three things 



Bug 1 : The d key becuase it is now a shortcut, is not working when you go to type in a input box. 



Plan: How can we use this app across other web browser pages. ( In its current state its is only a webpage for demo. We must create a chrome extension that leverages)

We have a half baked exention. ( Lets identify the buygs and get this rolling. )

#Idea add this as an example  for tranforming prompt in Prompt OS

Prompt Transformer: 

Lets update the icon over lay. I do not want two icons. Only show the bug icon. When clicked shift to the search Icon not a green checkmark. when the user presses the search icon again it will toggle of going back to the bug icon. 

update the floating toggle button to have just two states:
Bug Icon (üêõ) - LogTrace is OFF
Search Icon (üîç) - LogTrace is ON
When clicked, it toggles between these two states. Let me find and update the content script
