# Pre-Launch Checklist: Positioning as a "Context Engine for AI Development"

This checklist outlines the priorities for aligning the product with its new strategic direction before pre-launch, based on the analysis in `docs/uniqueValueAdd.md`.

## Phase 1: Core Product & Messaging Alignment

The goal of this phase is to ensure the product itself and its messaging reflect the new "Context Engine" positioning.

- [ ] **Reframe All User-Facing Copy:**
  - [ ] **Website/Landing Page:** Update headlines and descriptions to focus on "Stop Describing Bugs. Start Showing Them." instead of generic debugging language.
  - [ ] **Extension Store Listing:** Revise the name, short description, and long description in `extension/manifest.json` and for the store page itself.
  - [ ] **In-App Content:** Ensure all tooltips, modals, and onboarding messages communicate the value of providing rich context to AI.

- [ ] **Enhance "Context Engineering" Feature:**
  - [ ] **Define the "Perfect Context Package":** Brainstorm and define what structured data constitutes a perfect, context-rich package for an AI. This should go beyond just HTML and include:
    - Parent element hierarchy
    - Computed CSS styles
    - Associated component/framework state (if detectable)
    - Related console errors or warnings
  - [ ] **Implement Enhanced Context Gathering:** Update the core logic to capture this richer, structured context when a user inspects an element.
  - [ ] **Create a "Copy for AI" button:** Add a feature that formats the captured context into a clean, markdown-formatted block that users can easily paste into their AI assistant of choice.

## Phase 2: Go-to-Market Preparation

This phase focuses on creating the assets and materials needed to attract the target audience.

- [ ] **Develop Target Audience-Specific Content:**
  - [ ] **Create Viral Demo Videos:** Record short, compelling screen captures of using the tool to solve a real-world UI bug with an AI assistant (e.g., ChatGPT, Cursor). Show the "before" (manual description) and "after" (one-click context capture).
  - [ ] **Write Blog Posts/Articles:** Author content aimed at "Agentic Developers," explaining the concept of "Context Engineering" and how it improves AI-driven development workflows.

- [ ] **Update Marketing & Distribution Channels:**
  - [ ] **Website Relaunch:** Redesign the landing page to be a single, clear funnel for the new positioning, featuring the demo video prominently.
  - [ ] **Prepare for Social Media:** Create a backlog of posts, GIFs, and short videos for platforms where your target audience is active (e.g., X/Twitter, dev-focused subreddits).

## Phase 3: Future-Proofing & Strategic Roadmap

This phase sets the stage for post-launch growth and reinforces the tool's unique position.

- [ ] **Plan Direct AI Tool Integrations:**
  - [ ] **Research Integration Points:** Investigate the APIs or extension capabilities of primary target tools like Cursor, VS Code (for Copilot), and others.
  - [ ] **Scope First Integration:** Define the MVP for a direct "Send to..." integration with one key AI partner. This will be a major feature post-launch.

- [ ] **Final Polish and Review:**
  - [ ] **Full Product Walkthrough:** Use the tool from the perspective of an "Agentic Developer." Does it feel essential? Does it save significant time?
  - [ ] **Review Onboarding:** Ensure the first-time user experience quickly delivers the "aha!" moment of seeing the high-quality context captured.
