# Security Documentation

## Overview

LogTrace implements comprehensive security measures to protect user data and prevent common vulnerabilities. This document outlines our security practices and recommendations for users.

## Security Features Implemented

### 1. Input Validation & Sanitization

- **Enhanced Input Validation**: All user inputs are validated using `enhancedValidation` utilities
- **XSS Protection**: Comprehensive sanitization prevents script injection attacks
- **SQL Injection Protection**: Input validation specifically designed to prevent SQL injection
- **Rate Limiting**: Built-in rate limiting prevents abuse and brute force attacks

### 2. Database Security

- **Row Level Security (RLS)**: All tables have proper RLS policies enforcing data access controls
- **Security Definer Functions**: Database functions include `SET search_path = ''` for security
- **Encrypted Storage**: Sensitive data is properly encrypted before storage

### 3. Authentication Security

- **Supabase Authentication**: Leverages enterprise-grade authentication infrastructure
- **JWT Token Management**: Secure token handling with automatic refresh
- **Session Management**: Proper session lifecycle management

### 4. Chrome Extension Security

- **Content Security Policy**: Strict CSP prevents code injection
- **Secure Storage**: API keys and credentials are encrypted in extension storage
- **Permission Management**: Minimal required permissions following least privilege principle

### 5. API Security

- **User Authentication**: All API endpoints require valid authentication
- **Input Sanitization**: All API inputs are validated and sanitized
- **Error Handling**: Secure error handling prevents information leakage

## Security Best Practices for Users

### 1. API Key Management

⚠️ **CRITICAL**: Never store API keys in plain text or hardcode them in your applications.

- Use the secure storage features provided by LogTrace
- Rotate API keys regularly
- Never share API keys in public repositories or communications
- Use environment variables for server-side applications

### 2. Password Security

- Use strong, unique passwords for your LogTrace account
- Enable two-factor authentication when available
- Never share your credentials with others

### 3. Data Privacy

- LogTrace only processes data necessary for debugging functionality
- No sensitive data is logged or transmitted unless explicitly requested
- User data is encrypted in transit and at rest

## Security Configuration

### Supabase Security Settings

To ensure maximum security, configure the following in your Supabase project:

1. **Enable Password Security**: 
   - Go to Supabase Dashboard → Authentication → Settings
   - Enable "Check for leaked passwords"
   - Set minimum password length to 8+ characters
   - Require mixed case letters, numbers, and symbols

2. **Configure RLS Policies**: All tables should have appropriate RLS policies

3. **Review Database Functions**: Ensure all functions include `SET search_path = ''`

### Chrome Extension Security

1. **Keep Extension Updated**: Always use the latest version for security patches
2. **Review Permissions**: Only grant necessary permissions to the extension
3. **Secure Storage**: API keys are automatically encrypted by the extension

## Vulnerability Reporting

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly:

1. **DO NOT** create public GitHub issues for security vulnerabilities
2. Email security concerns to: [Your security email]
3. Include detailed steps to reproduce the issue
4. Allow reasonable time for patching before public disclosure

## Security Audit History

- **v1.0.18**: Comprehensive security review and hardening
  - Fixed hardcoded credentials in Chrome extension

- Privacy by design principles

## Emergency Security Response

In case of a security incident:

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Change all passwords and API keys
   - Review access logs for unauthorized activity
   - Contact support immediately

2. **LogTrace Response**:
   - Security incidents are treated with highest priority
   - Patches are released as quickly as possible
