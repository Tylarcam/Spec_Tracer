- ✅ All tables have proper Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- ✅ Database functions are properly secured

### 2. Chrome Extension Security
- ✅ Removed hardcoded Supabase credentials from `extension/popup.js`
- ✅ Implemented secure storage utility (`extension/secureStorage.js`)
- ✅ Added Content Security Policy (CSP) to manifest
- ✅ Encrypted API key storage in extension
- ✅ Updated extension version to 1.0.18

### 3. Input Validation & Sanitization
- ✅ Enhanced input validation with security patterns
- ✅ XSS protection implemented
- ✅ SQL injection prevention
- ✅ Rate limiting enhanced with multiple layers

### 4. Authentication Security
- ✅ Secure token handling
- ✅ Enhanced password validation
- ✅ Rate limiting for authentication attempts

### 5. API Security
- ✅ Enhanced rate limiting for API calls
- ✅ Security headers configuration
- ✅ Malicious content detection

## ⚠️ Manual Configuration Required

### 1. Enable Leaked Password Protection
**REQUIRED**: This must be done manually in the Supabase dashboard:

1. Go to [Supabase Dashboard → Authentication → Settings](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/kepmuysqytngtqterosr/auth/providers?provider=Email)
2. Scroll to "Password Security" section
3. Enable "Check for leaked passwords"
4. Set minimum password length to 8+ characters
5. Enable requirements for:
   - At least one lowercase letter
   - At least one uppercase letter
   - At least one number
   - At least one special character

### 2. Review Security Settings
1. Verify RLS policies are enabled on all tables
2. Check that proper permissions are set for API keys
3. Review user access controls

## 🚨 Critical Security Notes

1. **API Keys**: Never store API keys in plain text or commit them to version control
2. **Credentials**: Use the secure storage utilities provided
3. **Updates**: Keep the extension and dependencies updated
4. **Monitoring**: Monitor for unusual activity or failed authentication attempts
5. **Access Control**: Regularly review user permissions and access levels

## 📋 Post-Implementation Verification

After enabling leaked password protection:

1. ✅ Run security linter: `supabase db lint`
2. ✅ Test authentication flow with new password requirements
3. ✅ Verify rate limiting is working correctly
4. ✅ Test input validation on all forms
5. ✅ Verify extension secure storage is functioning

## 🔄 Regular Security Maintenance

### Monthly
- Review access logs for unusual activity
- Update dependencies and check for security patches
- Review and rotate API keys if necessary

### Quarterly
- Perform comprehensive security audit
- Review and update RLS policies
- Test disaster recovery procedures

### Annually
- Full penetration testing (recommended)
- Review and update security documentation
- Security training for team members

## 📞 Security Incident Response

If a security issue is discovered:

1. **Immediate**: Disable affected functionality if possible
2. **Within 1 hour**: Change all potentially compromised credentials
3. **Within 24 hours**: Patch the vulnerability
4. **Within 48 hours**: Notify affected users if personal data was involved
